The All C-ing Hat is a hat that can detect objects around it up to 1 meter away. The hat signals the wearer by sounding a buzzer. The pitch of the buzzer increases as objects get closer. LEDs blink to alert those around the wearer.

HC-SR04 and pitches are libraries that need to be installed
on the arduino IDE.

Please see the circuit diagram for wire set up.

When adding LEDs, use a 220Ohm resistor between the input and LED.
